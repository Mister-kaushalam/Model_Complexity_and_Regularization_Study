# Model Complexity and Regularization Study

# Impact of Model Complexity and Regularization on Model Generalization

## Abstract
This project investigates the relationship between model complexity, regularization, and generalization capabilities using classification tasks. The experiments explore the impact of polynomial data transformations and regularization techniques on \(E_{in}\) and \(E_{out}\). Insights are derived through structured experimentation and visualizations.

Key findings include the trade-offs between model complexity and generalization, and the effectiveness of regularization techniques in improving model robustness.


## Methodology

This project employs the following datasets and methods:

- **Datasets**: Classification and regression datasets provided for analysis.
- **Techniques**: Logistic regression, polynomial feature transformations, regularization methods like Ridge and Lasso, and cross-validation.
- **Tools**: Implemented using Python with libraries such as NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for computation and visualization.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Training error (Ein), validation error (Eval), and out-of-sample error (Eout) are used to evaluate model performance.

### Workflow Overview:
- **Step 1:** Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- **Step 2:** Applying transformations and training models for classification and regression.
- **Step 3:** Evaluating the impact of model complexity and regularization.
- **Step 4:** Cross-validation and comparative analysis of Ridge and Lasso regularization.

### Datasets Used:
- **Classification Dataset:** Features and target for binary classification.


## Summary of Results

- **Logistic Regression:** Adding polynomial features significantly improved classification accuracy by enhancing linear separability, while regularization controlled overfitting.
- **Regression Analysis:** Optimal polynomial degree and regularization parameter minimized \(E_{out}\), highlighting the trade-off between model complexity and generalization.
- **Cross-Validation:** Demonstrated the reliability of model performance metrics across folds.
- **Ridge vs. Lasso:** Ridge regression produced smoother weight distributions, while Lasso facilitated feature selection.
